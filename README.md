# Arduino-Nano-based-Designing-Stick-Man-Animation-on-LCD-Screen
<strong>Solo Project: Stick Man Animation on LCD Screen</strong><br><br>
LCD functions as a character viewer. Generally, the characters displayed are in the form of writing, but actually LCD can also display images, even LCD can also display an animation from the results of looping. The purpose of this project is to educate the public on how to make easy character customization on I2C LCD. This project has been implemented and takes approximately 1 day. The result of this project is Stick Man animation.

## Scanning the I2C Address on the LCD
```ino
#include <Wire.h>

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial); // Wait for serial monitor
  Serial.println("\nI2C Scanner");
}

void loop() {
  int nDevices = 0;
  Serial.println("Scanning...");

  for (byte address = 1; address < 127; ++address) {
    // The i2c_scanner uses the return value of the Wire.endTransmission to see if a device did acknowledge to the address.
    Wire.beginTransmission(address);
    byte error = Wire.endTransmission();

    if (error == 0) {
      Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
      if (address < 16) {
        Serial.print("0");
      }
      Serial.print(address, HEX);
      Serial.println("  !");

      ++nDevices;
    } else if (error == 4) {
      Serial.print("Unknown error at address 0x");
      if (address < 16) {
        Serial.print("0");
      }
      Serial.println(address, HEX);
    }
  }
  if (nDevices == 0) {
    Serial.println("No I2C devices found\n");
  } else {
    Serial.println("done\n");
  }
  delay(5000); // Wait 5 seconds for next scan
}
```
